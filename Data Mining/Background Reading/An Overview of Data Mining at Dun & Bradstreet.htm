<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p>Data mining, <b><i>the extraction of hidden predictive information from large databases</i></b>,
is a powerful new technology with great potential to help D&amp;B "preemptively
define the information market of tomorrow." Data mining tools predict future trends
and behaviors, allowing businesses to make proactive, knowledge-driven decisions. The
automated, <i>prospective analyses</i> offered by data mining move beyond the analyses of
past events provided by retrospective tools. Data mining answers business questions that
traditionally were too time-consuming to resolve. Data mining tools scour databases for
hidden patterns, finding predictive information that experts may miss because it lies
outside their expectations. </p>

<p>D&amp;B companies already know how to collect and refine massive quantities of data to
deliver relevant and actionable business information. In this sense, D&amp;B has been
"mining" data for years. Today, some D&amp;B units are already using data mining
technology to deliver new kinds of answers that rank high in the business value chain
because they directly fuel return-on-investment decisions. </p>

<p>Data mining techniques can be implemented rapidly on existing software and hardware
platforms across D&amp;B to enhance the value of existing resources, and can be integrated
with new products and systems as they are brought on-line. When implemented on high
performance client-server or parallel processing computers, data mining tools can analyze
massive databases while a customer or analyst takes a coffee break, then deliver answers
to questions such as, "Which clients are most likely to respond to my next
promotional mailing, and why?" </p>

<p>In the D&amp;B units DIG surveyed, we found strong interest and a wide range of
activities and research in data mining. Groups are engaged in data mining to varying
degrees, from experimentation by individual analysts to the deployment of completed
projects. We also found a wealth of potential business opportunities that could open up
through data mining technology. </p>

<p>The breadth of D&amp;B's collected data places the company in a unique position to take
advantage of the fact that data mining tools produce better results with larger, broader
databases. By integrating data mining into its products and services, D&amp;B can leverage
its existing resources to achieve new revenue. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>1. A Strategic Opportunity for D&amp;B</h2>

<p>D&amp;B units are connected through the common goal of delivering integrated, global
solutions to support business decisions. In accomplishing this goal across a broad
spectrum of markets, D&amp;B units face similar market pressures and opportunities. For
example, customers urgently require tools to help them keep pace with accelerating growth
in the size and complexity of business data. At the same time, customers demand ever more
timely, sophisticated, and widely integrated data analyses. </p>

<p>D&amp;B units work hard today to maintain their leadership against a growing
competitive threat from other vendors. These vendors have often aggressively exploited new
technology to capture market advantage. While D&amp;B units have responded successfully to
these competitive challenges in the past, the question remains: What new technology is
becoming available today that D&amp;B can leverage proactively? </p>

<p>Data mining is such a technology. D&amp;B is in a unique position to take the lead in
delivering the benefits of data mining technology to customers. The company has a wealth
of data unrivaled in its breadth and depth, and the understanding of the relevant markets
that is necessary to bring this technology to customers successfully. D&amp;B units are
engaged in markets where data mining can have significant impact. These markets use large
databases and need the power of data mining to achieve a better understanding of their
data. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>2. The Scope of Data Mining</h2>

<p>Data mining derives its name from the similarities between searching for valuable
business information in a large database - for example, finding linked products in
Nielsen's gigabytes of store scanner data - and mining a mountain for a vein of valuable
ore. Both processes require either sifting through an immense amount of material, or
intelligently probing it to find exactly where the value resides. </p>

<p>Given databases of sufficient size and quality, data mining technology can generate new
business opportunities by providing these capabilities: 

</p><ul>
  <li><b>Automatic prediction of trends and behaviors.</b> Data mining automates the process
    of finding predictive information in large databases. Questions that traditionally
    required extensive hands-on analysis can now be answered directly from the data - quickly.
    A typical example of a predictive problem is targeted marketing. Data mining uses data on
    past promotional mailings to identify the targets most likely to maximize return on
    investment in future mailings. Other predictive problems include forecasting bankruptcy
    and other forms of default, and identifying segments of a population likely to respond
    similarly to given events. <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Automatic discovery of previously unknown patterns.</b> Data mining tools sweep
    through databases and identify previously hidden patterns in one step. An example of
    pattern discovery is the analysis of retail sales data to identify seemingly unrelated
    products that are often purchased together. Other pattern discovery problems include
    detecting fraudulent credit card transactions and identifying <i>anomalous data</i> that
    could represent data entry keying errors. <br>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Data mining techniques can yield the benefits of automation when implemented on
existing software and hardware platforms at D&amp;B, and can be implemented on new systems
as existing platforms are upgraded and new products developed. When data mining tools are
implemented on high performance parallel processing systems, they can analyze massive
databases in minutes. Faster processing means that users can automatically experiment with
more <i>models</i> to understand complex data. High speed makes it practical for users to
analyze huge quantities of data. Larger databases, in turn, yield improved predictions.
Databases can be larger in two senses: 

</p><ul>
  <li><b>Higher dimensionality.</b> In hands-on analyses, analysts must often limit the number
    of variables they examine because of time constraints. Yet variables that are discarded
    because they seem unimportant may carry information about unknown patterns. High
    performance data mining allows users to explore the full dimensionality of a database,
    without preselecting a subset of variables. </li>
  <li><b>Larger samples.</b> Larger samples yield lower estimation errors and variance, and
    allow users to make inferences about small segments of a population. <br>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A recent Gartner Group Advanced Technology Research Note listed data mining and
Artificial Intelligence at the top of the five key technology areas that "will
clearly have a major impact across a wide range of industries within the next three to
five years." Gartner also listed parallel architectures and data mining as two of the
top ten new technologies in which companies will invest during the next five years.
According to a recent Gartner HPC Research Note, "With the rapid advance in data
capture, transmission and storage, large-systems users will increasingly need to implement
new and innovative ways to mine the after-market value of their vast stores of detail
data, employing MPP [massively parallel processing] systems to create new sources of
business advantage (0.9 probability)." </p>

<p>At D&amp;B, data mining technology provides a basis for new products and for
enhancements to existing offerings. For example, at DBIS, data mining tools can be used to
automate more elements of the process of building risk models for a variety of markets.
Data mining can present a Nielsen customer with the top ten most significant new buying
patterns each week, or present an IMS customer with patterns of sales calls and marketing
promotions that have significant impact within certain market niches. </p>

<p>Some of the most commonly used techniques in data mining are: 

</p><ul>
  <li><b>Artificial neural networks</b>: Non-linear predictive models that learn through
    training and resemble biological neural networks in structure. </li>
  <li><b>Genetic algorithms</b>: Optimization techniques that use processes such as genetic
    combination, mutation, and natural selection in a design based on the concepts of natural
    evolution. </li>
  <li><b>Decision trees</b>: Tree-shaped structures that represent sets of decisions. These
    decisions generate rules for the classification of a dataset. Specific decision tree
    methods include Classification and Regression Trees (CART) and Chi Square Automatic
    Interaction Detection (CHAID) . CART and CHAID are decision tree techniques used for
    classification of a dataset. They provide a set of rules that you can apply to a new
    (unclassified) dataset to predict which records will have a given outcome. CART segments a
    dataset by creating 2-way splits while CHAID segments using chi square tests to create
    multi-way splits. CART typically requires less data preparation than CHAID. </li>
  <li><b>Nearest neighbor method</b>: A technique that classifies each record in a dataset
    based on a combination of the classes of the <i>k</i> record(s) most similar to it in a
    historical dataset (where <i>k</i> 1). Sometimes called the <i>k</i>-nearest neighbor
    technique. </li>
  <li><b>Rule induction</b>: The extraction of useful if-then rules from data based on
    statistical significance. </li>
  <li><b>Data visualization</b>: The visual interpretation of complex relationships in
    multidimensional data. </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>3. The Foundations of Data Mining</h2>

<p>Data mining techniques are the result of a long process of research and product
development. This evolution began when business data were first stored on computers,
continued with improvements in data access, and more recently, generated technologies that
allow users to navigate through their data in real time. Data mining takes this
evolutionary process beyond retrospective data access and navigation to prospective and
proactive information delivery. </p>

<p>Data mining is ready for application in the business community because it is supported
by three technologies that are now sufficiently mature: 

</p><ul>
  <li>Massive data collection and storage </li>
  <li>Powerful multiprocessor computers </li>
  <li>Data mining algorithms </li>
</ul>

<p>Commercial databases are growing at unprecedented rates. The accompanying need for
improved computational engines can now be met in a cost-effective manner with parallel
multiprocessor computer technology. Data mining algorithms embody techniques that have
existed for at least ten years, but have only recently been implemented as mature,
reliable, understandable tools that consistently outperform older statistical methods. </p>

<p>In the evolution from business data to business information, each new step has built
upon the previous ones. For example, dynamic data access is critical for drill-through in
data navigation applications, and the ability to store large databases is critical to data
mining. From the user's point of view, the four steps listed in Table 1 were revolutionary
because they allowed new business questions to be answered accurately and quickly. </p>

<h2>4. Summary of Findings</h2>

<p>In the units we surveyed, we found strong interest and a wide range of activities and
research in data mining. Many groups are already engaged in data mining projects, from
research and experimentation by individual analysts to completed products that have
already added value to the business. We also found a wealth of potential business
opportunities that could become available with data mining technology. The following key
examples provide a flavor of the interest, activities, and opportunities we encountered: 

</p><ul>
  <li><b>Pilot Software</b> and DIG are exploring the potential of data mining with Pilot's
    state-of-the-art <i>multidimensional database</i> product line. A multidimensional
    database is one that has been designed for on-line analytical procession and is structured
    as a multidimensional hypercube. On-line analytical processing (OLAP) refers to
    array-oriented database applications that allow users to view, navigate through,
    manipulate, and analyze multidimensional databases. This combination of technologies is
    expected to give Pilot a unique market advantage in meeting customers' demands for more
    and better information. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><b>DBIS</b> units around the world are constantly exploring ways to provide customers
    with more and better business information. In the Analytical Services group at DBIS North
    America, analysts work with data mining techniques such as CART and CHAID, and actively
    pursue research in the theory and applications of neural networks. These analysts are
    investigating ways to use data mining to automate more of the repetitive, people-intensive
    portions of analytic tasks. Increased automation would allow the group to bring products
    to market more quickly, cutting costs and increasing revenues. It would also free analysts
    to focus on aspects of their work that cannot be automated. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>In Europe, <b>DBIS</b> analysts have been investigating PC-based data mining systems.
    They see data mining as a technology that can expand the scope of existing tools, bringing
    advanced analysis capabilities directly to customers. DBIS Japan, in its new alliance with
    Tokyo Shoko Research (TSR), is also providing new advanced technology for information
    management and analysis. The Data Intelligence Group (DIG) has been invited to present
    opportunities for collaboration with TSR in data mining projects. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Data mining technology is a next step in the evolution of <b>A. C.</b> <b>Nielsen</b>'s
    current software products and services. For example, data mining is seen as an essential
    component of the new solutions being developed by Nielsen and Pilot Software, Inc. in
    Europe. Data mining techniques could also open up new revenue opportunities by adding to
    the analytic capabilities of such Nielsen products as Opportunity Explorer, Promotion
    Simulator, and Nielsen Spotlight®. Because data mining tools perform best on very large
    databases, they are a natural candidate for adding value to Nielsen's new large data
    engines. Analysts at Nielsen have been investigating data mining technologies offered by
    IBM, Lockheed, Triada, and Pattern Associates. They are eager to find ways to detect
    anomalous data that can lead to distortions in analyses. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><b>IMS </b>analysts see data mining as a way to explore their high-dimensional databases
    to help clients better understand complex purchasing behavior. Analysts are investigating
    data mining products offered by third parties. DIG is participating in a project at IMS
    America to evaluate approaches in analyzing the volatility of physicians' prescribing
    patterns. IMS America analysts have also developed a neural network system for identifying
    defective data that can distort projections; the system is successful and in use. In
    Europe, IMS analysts use data visualization tools to provide customized analytic services
    for clients. Data visualization allows IMS to discover previously unknown facts and to
    confirm hypotheses about the pharmaceuticals market. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>At <b>Moody's</b>, the Public Finance Department is excited about the possibility of
    using data mining to deliver advanced tools to its own analysts' desktops. For example,
    data mining tools such as CART can assist analysts by identifying bonds that are likely to
    require a review. Data mining tools can also aid in socioeconomic forecasting and in
    selecting variables for comparing bond issuers. The Corporate Department has researched
    data mining techniques, and several of its analysts perform econometric modeling and risk
    analysis using neural networks, <i>k</i>-nearest-neighbor techniques, and genetic
    algorithms. <br>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We see distinct possibilities for synergy among D&amp;B units in the development and
application of data mining technology. While each unit has unique business goals, markets,
and customer problems, many different problems can be addressed using similar core data
mining technologies. For example, a classification tool such as CART can be used equally
well to identify municipal bonds whose underlying ratings criteria have changed
significantly, or to identify physicians whose prescription-writing patterns have changed.
A tool that selects the best variables to use in creating a credit-scoring model for the
telecommunications industry could equally well select the variables to use in comparing
performance profiles of retail sales channels. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>5. Conclusion</h2>

<p>This survey of a limited number of D&amp;B units points to quantifiable business
benefits achievable through the integration of data mining technology with D&amp;B
products and services. Data mining is a powerful technology with great potential for
adding value to the offerings of D&amp;B units. D&amp;B is in a remarkable position to
take advantage of this technology: it has the data, and it has the infrastructure to
support units in collaborating to solve shared problems. </p>

<p>The members of DIG are committed to seeing the benefits of data mining technology
delivered to D&amp;B customers and intends to further D&amp;B synergy in solving data
mining problems. We welcome suggestions for other useful activities and for collaboration
with analysts across D&amp;B. </p>

<hr>

<p>The Data Intelligence Group (DIG) was created by Dun &amp; Bradstreet as a center of
excellence in data mining. It is composed of scientists, developers, and marketing and
business analysts. DIG is part of Pilot Software, a Dun &amp; Bradstreet company that
develops and delivers OLAP database products. Prior to DIG, the five original members of
the group created the Darwin data mining software application developed at Thinking
Machines Corporation. </p>
