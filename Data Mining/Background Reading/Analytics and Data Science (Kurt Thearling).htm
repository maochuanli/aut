Data mining, if you haven't heard of it before, is <i>the
automated extraction of hidden predictive information from
databases</i>.&nbsp; I have spent much of my career&nbsp; building
commercial analytic and data mining systems, solving problems across fields
such as financial services, life sciences, retail, insurance, and
telecommunications.&nbsp; I am currently a consultant, working with clients to 
leverage data analysis to build business value (<a href="#aboutme">click

<p>
 The purpose of this web site is to share information about analytics and data 
	mining.&nbsp; I hope you find it useful.&nbsp;

<p><font color="#800000" size="4"><strong>What are analytics and data mining
good for?</strong></font> </p>

<p>Data mining software allows users to
analyze large databases to solve business decision problems. Data
mining is, in some ways, an extension of statistics, with a few
artificial intelligence and machine learning twists thrown in.
Like statistics, data mining is not a business solution, it is
just a technology.&nbsp; For example, consider a catalog retailer who needs to
decide who should receive information about a new product. The information
operated on by the data mining process is contained in a historical database of
previous interactions with customers and the features associated with the customers, such as age, zip code, their responses.
The data mining software would use this historical information to build a model of
customer behavior that could be used to predict which customers
would be likely to respond to the new product. By using this
information a marketing manager can select only the customers who
are most likely to respond.&nbsp; The operational business software can then feed the results of the
decision to the appropriate touch point systems (call centers, direct mail, web servers, email
systems, etc.) so that the right customers receive the right offers.</p>

          information from a database that the user did not know existed.

<p><font color="#800000" size="4"><strong><a name="aboutme">My Background</a>:</strong></font></p>

<p>I am currently working with consulting clients, helping them better leverage 
analytics.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I did this, I ran the analytics business for 
Vertex Business Services, a multi-national customer management company. I was 
the first analytics person hired at Vertex and built and led a Decision Sciences 
group spanning three continents.&nbsp; Our clients covered&nbsp; 
multiple industries including retail, utilities, healthcare, government, and 
financial services.</p><p>Before I joined Vertex, I led Capital One's advanced 
technology &amp; innovation organization, with a specific focus on accelerating the 
use of new ways to do data science.&nbsp; This involved developing a 
corporate-wide analytic infrastructure plan, managing relationships with key 
analytic vendors, and identifying and deploying new analytic tools and 
techniques across the company. 
</p><p>Before Capital One, I was director of Engineering at
AnVil, an <i>in silico</i> drug discovery company focused on the commercial
analysis of biological and clinical datasets.&nbsp; I was responsible for the development of AnVil's data analysis platform
technology (ADAPT), an award winning system of data mining tools used to
automate the analysis of everything from gene expression microarray data to
clinical healthcare records.</p><p>I came to AnVil from Wheelhouse, a
marketing technology and services company, where I was Chief Scientist. &nbsp; I founded the engineering
organization, managed software development efforts, and set technology strategy.&nbsp;
In addition, as a Wheelhouse senior management team member, I performed numerous
corporate duties including engaging clients, making sales calls, evaluating
technologies, public speaking, fundraising (including a $52M series B investment
round), etc.

</p><p>Prior to my position at Wheelhouse, I was Director of
Analytics at Xchange Inc., a leading CRM software vendor (and now part 
of Amdocs,
Inc.).&nbsp;
I was responsible for directing the integration of analytic applications
 (data
mining, customer optimization, decision support, and visualization) into
 Xchange's suite of marketing automation software 
applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Before Xchange, I co-founded the data mining group Dun &amp;
Bradstreet.&nbsp; At the time, D&amp;B was a complicated
collection of over twenty-five companies whose main purpose was to collect
information and turn it into a form that other companies could use.&nbsp; This
data covered everything from TV Ratings (Nielsen Media) to prescriptions (IMS) to
grocery purchases (A.C. Nielsen).&nbsp; Analyzing this data was a
major component to the business and I was a consultant to the various divisions,
providing help in the areas data mining and high-performance computing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I also worked with the Pilot Software division of D&amp;B, 
and developed new software applications to put data
mining solutions in the hands of business users.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>Before D&amp;B I was a senior scientist at an amazing company
called Thinking Machines Corporation. TMC was a pioneer in the
commercial development of massively parallel supercomputers.
While I was at Thinking Machines I
helped create Darwin, one of the first commercial data mining
applications.&nbsp; Our early work with Darwin made use of the massive
computational power available with a supercomputer but later versions
were adapted for use on less esoteric hardware.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TMC eventually
moved out of the supercomputer business and turned itself into a company focused
exclusively on the data mining software market. &nbsp; Oracle corporation
eventually acquired TMC and incorporated Darwin into their database platform.&nbsp; </p>
