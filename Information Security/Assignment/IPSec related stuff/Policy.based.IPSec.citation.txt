Abstract: Security is vital to the success of e-commerce and many new valued-added IP services. As a consequence, IPsec is an especially important security mechanism in that it provides cryptographic-based protection mechanisms for IP packets. Moreover, in order for IPsec to work properly, security policies that describe how different IP packets are protected must be provisioned on all network elements that offer IPsec protection. Since IPsec policies are quite complex, manually configuring them on individual network elements is inefficient and therefore infeasible for large-scale IPsec deployment. Policy-based IPsec management strives to solve this problem: Policy-based management employs a policy server to manage a network as a whole; it translates business goals or policies into network resource configurations and automates these configurations across multiple different network elements. Policy-based IPsec management significantly simplifies the task of defining, deploying, and maintaining security policies across a network, thereby significantly simplifying large-scale IPsec deployment. This article describes the motivations, key concepts, and recent IETF developments for policy-based IPsec management. It then applies the key concepts to an example a IPsec VPN service provisioning and further describes an example of an IPsec policy server as well as experience gained from implementing such a server. Challenges facing policy-based IPsec management are also discussed.
